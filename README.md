Advantages of Github

Version Control: GitHub is primarily a version control system. It allows you to keep track of changes you make to your code over time. This is especially valuable for students working on programming assignments or group projects, as you can easily revert to previous versions if something goes wrong.

Public and Private Repositories: GitHub offers both public and private repositories. Public repositories are great for sharing your work with the world, while private repositories are essential for keeping sensitive or unfinished projects secure.

Portfolio Showcase: GitHub serves as an excellent platform to showcase your coding skills and projects to potential employers. You can create a professional-looking profile that highlights your best work.

Issue Tracking: GitHub provides tools for issue tracking and project management. This is helpful for organizing tasks, reporting bugs, and collaborating with others on project planning.

Documentation: GitHub's built-in wiki and README files make it easy to document your projects. This is crucial for explaining your code to others, whether they're collaborators or potential employers.

Learning Resources: GitHub hosts numerous educational resources, tutorials, and coding exercises that can aid in your learning journey as a student.
